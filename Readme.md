<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This example is basically a Fungible Token faucet API which provides a possibility to distribute tokens among users by their request

Implementing server-side integration for communication with Near Protocol smart-contract has its own pros & cons - you must consider them when planning the use cases of your application

### Pros

- Additional features can be implemented (Authorization, Notifications, Delayed execution, etc)
- End users don't need to have deep knowledge about smart contracts, because they have a way to communicate through well-known REST API

### Cons

- Transactions that change state aren't free and must be paid - you'll pay for them
- Your application has to implement rate limits, so your Near funds wouldn't fire covering millions of unnecessary transactions
- Your smart contract's change methods must be closed from calling directly by the end-user otherwise someone would definitely call it directly avoiding your authorization

### Built With

- [![NodeJS][node.js]][next-url]
- [![Express][express.js]][react-url]
- [near-api-js (v1.1.0)](https://github.com/near/near-api-js)

### Demo

1. Retrieve initial balance for account
   ![](./images/postman_balance_before.png)
2. Then request allocation in 100 tokens for this account
